• Atomic indicators: Atomic indicators are obtained based on the context of an intrusion that has taken place. The “problem” with this type of indicators is that they do not have to be exclusive activity of a specific adversary, i.e. an atomic indicator can be identified in several intrusions of different adversaries. Some examples of these indicators are IP addresses, domains, the name of a path of a domain…
• Computed indicators: The concept of a calculated indicator is quite confusing. These indicators are developed from attributes that occur in an incident. For example, a hash of a file that has been seen in an incident can be calculated, so its MD5, SHA1… are calculated indicators. Another example could be a regular expression, which we can develop to detect something specific.
• behavioral indicators: These indicators are composed of a combination of the two types described above. For example, within this category we could state the following; “Adversaries established a C&C [IP and/or C&C domain] with the machine compromised by the [MD5 Hash] malware. Communications were executed at an interval of [Time interval] between client and server. They could be identified by searching for the regular expression [Identifying regular expression] in the proxy logs.”
